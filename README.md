# Ecommerce Website(DBMS mini project) 

Our fully dynamic and multi-vendor website is designed to cater to the needs of customers, sellers, and administrators. It consists of three sections, each serving a specific purpose and providing various functionalities.

- Section One: Customer<br>
In this section, customers can enjoy a seamless shopping experience. They have the ability to search for products, add items to their cart, find specific products using filters and categories, place orders, and track their shipments. Customers can explore a wide range of products offered by different sellers, compare prices and reviews, and make informed decisions. Our customer section prioritizes user-friendly navigation and a secure checkout process.

- Section Two: Seller<br>
The seller section is dedicated to empowering vendors to effectively manage their products and sales. Sellers can add new products to their inventory, update product information, including prices and stock levels. They can view a list of products they have sold, handle returns and refunds, and manage shipping details. Additionally, sellers can track their payments and review sales analytics to make data-driven business decisions.

- Section Three: Administration<br>
The administration section serves as the control center for the entire website. Administrators have the authority to manage both the customer and seller sections. They can oversee and moderate user activity, ensure compliance with the website's policies, handle disputes, and address any technical issues that may arise. Administrators also have the ability to configure website settings, such as payment gateways, shipping options, and overall site functionality.

Our fully dynamic and multi-vendor website provides a comprehensive platform for customers, sellers, and administrators, ensuring a smooth and efficient e-commerce experience for all parties involved. With its robust features and user-friendly interface, our website aims to facilitate seamless transactions, promote customer satisfaction, and support the growth of online businesses.
